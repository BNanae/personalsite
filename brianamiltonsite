<h1>Briana Milton</h1>
<hr>
<p>I would formally like to welcome you to my web page. I have created this page<br>
to showcase the skills that I have obtained and will be obtaining throughtout my <br>
web design course. I would also like to give a big thanks for taking the time<br>
to look at this beautiful tiny piece of the World Wide Web. I am very excited<br>
to see where web design will take me. I hope you have a wonderful day!</p>
<h2>Educational Goals</h2>
<p>One of my bigger goals , once I graduate, is to attend Sinclair Commmunity<br> 
College to gain a Web Programming Technical Certificate. Obtaining this certificate<br>
will take about two years. Once I am done with my two years at Sinclair and have<br>
gotten all my base classes done, another goal is to be able to transfer to Wright<br>
State University and get a Computer Science Bachelor Degree. I am very confident<br>
that I will conquer my goals and become a successful web designer.  </p>
<h2>Employment Goal</h2>
<p>I would like to be employed at a big company like google for web design mostly<br>
to maintain websites and then have a secondary job for making websites for small<br>
businesses. I want to get this type of job sometime before I graduate so I already<br>
have a job  set up for myself right when I get out of school. I want to achieve and<br>
set goals for myself along my journey as I become a professional web designer. I know<br>
that my mindset may change about things but for right now this is my dream and I plan<br>
on reaching my goal.<br></p>
